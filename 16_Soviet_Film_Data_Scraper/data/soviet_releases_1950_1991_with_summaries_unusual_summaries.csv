188,8,Заноза,,1956,Advertisement/promotional text,"The main character of the film, Leah, is a girl with a complex character. Working as a driver for various high-ranking officials, she does not recognize authority, which often leads to conflicts. For this she was nicknamed “Thorn”. Leah's passenger is the young architect Georgy, an opponent of excesses in construction. Having fallen in love with George, Leah joins in his struggle with supporters of the old (“Stalinist”) architecture. The script of the film was written specifically for Leila Abashidze after she played the central role in the film “Dragonfly”, and Leah was actually a variation of Marine (Abashidze’s character in “Dragonfly”), which did not escape the attention of critics (at the All-Union Creative Conference of Cinematographers in 1959, using the example of these two, the thesis about the monotony of Georgian film comedy was developed). The film became one of the leaders in Soviet film distribution in 1957 (7th place, 29.3 million viewers), but critical assessments were mixed. Thus, critic G. Fomin, in an article in the magazine “Art of Cinema,” spoke negatively about the work of the director and screenwriter, who did not fully use the possibilities of the musical comedy genre, but praised the songs of the composer S. Tsintsadze and the acting of L. Abashidze. The fact that the film largely owes its success to the central actress was emphasized by film critic S. Rizaev, comparing “Splinter” with the Armenian film “Her Fantasy”, which had a similar script, where such an actress was not found"

995,185,Во имя славы,Fame is the spur,1947,Advertisement/promotional text,"Fame is the Spur is a 1947 British drama film directed by Roy Boulting and starring Michael Redgrave, Rosamund John, Bernard Miles, David Tomlinson, Maurice Denham and Kenneth Griffith. It was written by Nigel Balchin based on the 1940 novel Fame Is the Spur by Howard Spring, which was believed to be based on the career of the Labor Party politician Ramsay MacDonald. Its plot involves a British politician who rises to power, abandoning on the way his radical views for more conservative ones. When Hamer Radshaw, a young man from a North country mill town, commits to help the poverty-stricken workers in his area, he takes as his Excalibur a sword passed down to him by his grandfather from the Battle of Peterloo, where it had been used against workers. As an idealistic champion of the oppressed, he rises to power as a Labor M.P., but is seduced by the trappings of power and finds himself the type of politician he originally despised. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: ""This film is the very polished technique to be expected of its director. It is excellently produced with an essentially north country institution, that of the knocker-up, and north country accents and atmosphere are, for the most part, well sustained where they are needed. Rosamund John gives a very natural performance, and her portrayal of Ann's attitude in the face of death must seem moving even to the most hardened viewer"

1023,12,Любовь под вязами,Desire Under the Elms,1958,Bot activity message,"Desire Under the Elms is a 1958 American film version of the 1924 play Desire Under the Elms written by Eugene O'Neill. The film was directed by Delbert Mann from a screenplay by O'Neill and Irwin Shaw. The cast included Sophia Loren as Abbie (known as Anna in the film), Anthony Perkins as Eben, Burl Ives as Ephraim, Frank Overton as Simeon, and Pernell Roberts as Peter. The film was nominated for Best Black and White Cinematography (Daniel L. Fapp) at the Academy Awards and Laurel Awards in 1959. It was also entered into the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. Widower Ephraim Cabot, a greedy New England farmer who has overworked two wives to their graves, works his three sons from the two women as slaves. The farm's land originally belonged to the second wife, and before her death she pleads with Eben, the youngest son, to take the farm from the old man as his birthright. Eben buys out his half-brothers' shares of the farm with money stolen from his father, and Peter and Simeon head off to California to seek their fortune. Ephraim announces that his desire is for the farm not to be left to anyone, but rather burned to the ground on his death. Later, Ephraim returns with a new wife, Anna, a beautiful and headstrong woman from Italy, who enters into an adulterous affair with Eben. Soon after, Anna bears Eben's child, but lets Ephraim believe that the child is his, with the old man's assurance that the farm shall be willed to her. The proud Ephraim is oblivious to his neighbors' open mocking of him as a cuckold. Eben and Anna argue and, in a fit of jealousy because of comments from his father, Eben tells Anna he wishes the baby were dead and desires to never see Anna again. Madly in love with Eben and fearful of losing him because of the argument, Anna kills the infant, thinking this will prove to Eben her commitment to him. However, an angry and distraught Eben threatens to tell the sheriff what she has done and departs. Before the sheriff arrives Eben returns to the farm and admits to Anna the depths of his love for her and confesses his own role in the infanticide. The old man condemns them both, calls out God, and is content that the farm will not fall into anyone's hands. The sheriff comments to his deputy that he wishes he could possess such a special farm as Ephraim's and then takes the two lovers to jail. Don Hartman acquired the story for Paramount Pictures and took it over when he left Paramount to become an independent producer. He died shortly after its release"

The film, made in the DEFA studios in the GDR, is an adaptation of the Grimm fairy tale King Thrushbeard. After the repairs have been completed, the princess arrives late at the festival of her father, King Dandelion, where she is supposed to choose a husband. But none of the noblemen present are good enough for the headstrong princess, neither King Wenzel zu Weinreich, the Thirteenth, nor Junker Balduin von enstreich, nor Prince Zacharias von Zacken Schwert, nor Duke Adolar von Antenpfiff, nor Prince Casimir, nor Count Eitelfritz von Supp, nor even her father's favorite, King Heinz Eduard. Instead, she mocks and mocks the suitors. The stranger is also present, whom the princess immediately gives the name “King Thrushbeard” because of his beard. Her father is angry about his daughter's behavior and decides that the princess must take as her husband the first beggar who appears in front of the castle. The stranger then stands in front of the castle gate disguised as a minstrel; the spurned suitors remind the now hesitant king of his word. The protesting princess has no choice but to marry the minstrel. The king then orders her out of the castle and she sets off with her husband. When she learns that the great forest, the green meadow and the beautiful city belong to King Thrushbeard, she regrets not having taken him as her husband. When she really wants an apple at the market, the minstrel teaches her a lesson that you have to earn the fulfillment of your wishes; The spoiled princess also has to get used to life in a simple hut without servants and to gainful employment. The minstrel's attempts to teach her basket weaving and spinning fail because of the princess's lack of stamina. A little later she achieved her first successes on the market by selling self-painted pots and jugs. The day, when she sits on the corner of the market against the advice of those around her in order to stand out from the other market women, a ruthless rider (who later turns out to be King Thrushbeard) destroys her goods. Out of shame, she no longer dares to go and sits crying in the forest. There is a kitchen boy from the castle finds her, who is collecting mushrooms, and takes her with him. So the princess becomes a kitchen maid for King Hans, not knowing that she is in King Thrushbeard's castle. This lets them initially everywhere. After a tip from the cook, he organizes a party at his castle and introduces the kitchen maid as Princess Roswitha and his bride to the surprised party community. At first she doesn't recognize him as the minstrel and tries to run away. After King Hans reveals himself, the princess forgives the king for his deceptive maneuvers; They both get married and take a carriage ride into the forest"

For this reason, Danny's girlfriend, celebrity singer Cindy Adams (Gogi Grant), has decided not to sign a contract with Randall Records"

The screenplay by Roberto Gianviti was based on Jack London's 1906 novel White Fang. The film was part of a trend of European Northwesterns inspired during the 1970s by Call of the Wild (1972), which was a surprise hit in Italy. Two German productions in this trend were Hellhounds of Alaska and Cry of the Black Wolves, both directed by Harald Reinl. The film gained great commercial success and gened an official sequel, Challenge to White Fang (1974) as well as several derivatives, including White Fang to the Rescue (1974) and White Fang and the Hunter (1975). Set in the year 1896 in the Yukon Wilderness, the film opens when Charlie (Daniel Martin) an Aboriginal Canadian fur trader, discovers his young son Mitsah (Missaele) attempting to befriend a wolf, he scares the beast away, believing it to be too wild and dangerous. Unknown to him, his son persists. Mitsah names the animal White Fang because of the ivory-white teeth the beast sprouts. That night, Charlie changes his mind about the animal when it arrives at his hut barking furiously. Mitsah, while strolling through the woods at night to meet his friend, falls through the thin ice of a frozen lake and the animal, a wolf/dog cross breed, raises the alarm. Mitsah is saved by his father and canine friend, but falls seriously ill with hypothermia after his plunge into the icy water. Charlie decides to take his son for medical treatment at the nearest settlement. While carrying Mitsah down a mountainside, he meets an old friend named Kurt Johnson (Raimund Harmstorf) a fellow fur trapper who agrees to help Charlie carry the barely conscious Mitsah. Kurt tells them the nearest town is a place called Dawson City, in which he informs them that it is not safe there.

His mother wants to celeb this event solemnly and invites Vila to gather his friends and invite his girlfriend, whom he does not have, to the holiday. Vilya turns to a casual acquaintance Olya with a request to play the role of his girlfriend at the event. Their short communication leads to intimacy and understanding of the uncertainty of further relationships. Asya Vedeneeva, a former school graduate, secretly in love with her literature teacher Larikov, returns to the city. Asya, now a medical student, married a boring, mercantile man - cutter Ganin. She wants to congratulate Larikov on his birthday by buying him an expensive gift, but the teacher remains indifferent to her feelings. Having sailed on an inflatable boat away from the shore, Asya tries to drown herself; Vilya, who happened to be at the rescue station, pulls her ashore. Asya confesses to a former classmate and tells him that she is expecting a child. The heroes feel spiritual unity. Ganin arranges a scene of jealousy for Larikov, threatening him with a gun, but gives in to his composure, realizing that the accusations against him are unfounded. Film critic R. N. Yurenev wrote that director S.

3852,81,Аукцион,,1983,Advertisement/promotional text,"1980, Vneshtorg organizes a horse auction for foreigners at the Progress stud farm, to which the great German horse lover Baron von Ritter comes. The Baron is interested in Sekunda, a descendant of a horse named Grabe, once taken as reparations after the war. But the director of the stud farm, Ermakov, who was a groom at that time, knows that under the name Grabe was his Nadezhda - in 1942, the Germans stole purebred breeding horses, including her, a direct successor of the line of the legendary horse Atlant, the horse of the Russian emperor. Nadezhda was returned in 1945, but according to the documents she was outbred to Grabe - someone replaced the breeding certificate. Ermakov, quarreling with representatives of Vneshtorg, does not want to sell horses, which foreigners buy for ridiculous money without documents confirming their pedigree. He realizes that it is no coincidence that Baron von Ritter is interested in Secunda, apparently he has a real tribal certificate of Nadezhda... but where did he get it, and who is the respectable businessman von Ritter? By chance, Ritter, who found himself at the stables, helps Ermakov der a difficult birth to one of the mares, after which they begin to trust each other - and a frank conversation takes place about the events of 1942. Ritter offers a deal, but Ermakov flatly refuses. Then - in 1942 he could not save Nadezhda, in 1945 he could not return her name, and now he is forced to sell her granddaughter Sekunda. At the auction, foreigners buy horses for 5-8 thousand dollars, and then Ermakov takes a risk and bluffs - he puts Sekunda up for auction for 100 thousand dollars, declaring that this is the granddaughter of Nadezhda, the great-granddaughter of Atlant, which is confirmed by captured documents with the baron’s seal. Ritter is forced to enter into a bargain, thereby admitting that Grabe was Nadezhda: the price soars to $3 million and the horse is removed from the auction. The film was sharply criticized by Valery Turovsky in the magazine “Art of Cinema”, where he pointed out that despite the enormous potential of the script - “a great many plot and thematic branches, among which there are so many important, relevant ones that would be enough for a good five ”, the authors, gaining the trust of the viewer by exploiting the theme of war, which is shown in rare frames, created a meaningless film without “any significant content, any mature (not to mention the hard-won) author’s thought"

It stars William Hurt, Lee Marvin, Joanna Pacuła (in her first American film), Rikki Fulton, Brian Dennehy, Ian McDiarmid, Richard Griffiths, Michael Elphick and Ian Bannen. The plot follows Arkady Renko (Hurt), a Moscow police investigator, on the trail of a gruesome triple murder that leads him into a web of government corruption. Upon release, Gorky Park was a box office disappointment, barely earning its $15 million budget, but received positive reviews from critics. Pacuła was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture and Elphick for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. Dennis Potter won a 1984 Edgar Award for his screenplay for the film. Moscow militia officer Arkady Renko is called to a clearing near the Gorky Park ice rink, where three bodies – two men and one woman – have been discovered. All were shot in the chest and their faces and finger tips removed; the two men were also shot in the mouth. Renko becomes anxious when the KGB, led by his nemesis Major Pribluda, refuses to take over the investigation. Renko traces the dead woman's skates to a movie set worker, Irina Asanova, who claims they were stolen. The pathologist identifies one young man as a foreigner, likely an American.
